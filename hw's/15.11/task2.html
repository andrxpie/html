      <article class="biography">
        <p>
          William Shakespeare (bapt. 26 April 1564 â€“ 23 April 1616) was an
          English poet, playwright and actor, widely regarded as the greatest
          writer in the English language and the world's greatest dramatist. He
          is often called England's national poet and the "Bard of Avon". His
          extant works, including collaborations, consist of approximately 39
          plays, 154 sonnets, two long narrative poems, and a few other verses,
          some of uncertain authorship. His plays have been translated into
          every major living language and are performed more often than those of
          any other playwright.
        </p>

        <p>
          Shakespeare was born and raised in Stratford-upon-Avon, Warwickshire.
          At the age of 18, he married Anne Hathaway, with whom he had three
          children: Susanna and twins Hamnet and Judith. Sometime between 1585
          and 1592, he began a successful career in London as an actor, writer,
          and part-owner of a playing company called the Lord Chamberlain's Men,
          later known as the King's Men. At age 49 (around 1613), he appears to
          have retired to Stratford, where he died three years later. Few
          records of Shakespeare's private life survive; this has stimulated
          considerable speculation about such matters as his physical
          appearance, his sexuality, his religious beliefs, and whether the
          works attributed to him were written by others. Such theories are
          often criticised for failing to adequately note that few records
          survive of most commoners of the period.
        </p>

        <p>
          Shakespeare produced most of his known works between 1589 and 1613.
          His early plays were primarily comedies and histories and are regarded
          as some of the best work produced in these genres. Until about 1608,
          he wrote mainly tragedies, among them Hamlet, Othello, King Lear, and
          Macbeth, all considered to be among the finest works in the English
          language. In the last phase of his life, he wrote tragicomedies (also
          known as romances) and collaborated with other playwrights.
        </p>

        <p>
          Many of Shakespeare's plays were published in editions of varying
          quality and accuracy in his lifetime. However, in 1623, two fellow
          actors and friends of Shakespeare's, John Heminges and Henry Condell,
          published a more definitive text known as the First Folio, a
          posthumous collected edition of Shakespeare's dramatic works that
          included all but two of his plays. The volume was prefaced with a poem
          by Ben Jonson, in which Jonson presciently hails Shakespeare in a
          now-famous quote as "not of an age, but for all time".
        </p>

        <p>
          Throughout the 20th and 21st centuries, Shakespeare's works have been
          continually adapted and rediscovered by new movements in scholarship
          and performance. His plays remain popular and are studied, performed,
          and reinterpreted through various cultural and political contexts
          around the world.
