    <h1>Mathematical formulas</h1>

<h2>Linear Equations</h2>

<p>A linear equation is any equation that can be written in the form</p>

  <div><samp>ax + b = 0</samp></div>

<p>where <strong>a</strong> and <strong>b</strong> are real numbers and <strong>x</strong> is a variable. This form is sometimes called the standard form of a linear equation. Note that most linear equations will not start off in this form. Also, the variable may or may not be an <strong>x</strong> so donâ€™t get too locked into always seeing an <strong>x</strong> there.</p>

<h2>Quadratic Equation</h2>

<p>The standard form of a quadratic equation looks like this:</p>

  <div><samp>ax<sup>2</sup> + bx + c = 0</samp></div>

<p>where <strong>a</strong>, <strong>b</strong>, <strong>c</strong> are known values and <strong>x</strong> is the variable or unknown (we don't know it yet). Also, <strong>a</strong> can't be 0.</p>

<h2>The area of a circle (A)</h2>

<p><strong>&#960;</strong> (Pi) times the radius (<strong>r</strong>) squared:</p>

  <div><samp>A = &#960; &#10799; r<sup>2</sup></samp></div>

<p>or, when you know the diameter (<strong>D</strong>):</p>
  <div><samp>(A = &#960; / 4) &#10799; D<sup>2</sup></samp></div>

<p>or, when you know the circumference (<strong>C</strong>):</p>
  <div><samp>A = C<sup>2</sup> / 4 &lowast; &#960;</samp></div>

<h2>Intersection</h2>

<p>The intersection of two sets <strong>A</strong> and <strong>B</strong>, denoted by A &cap; B, is the set of all objects that are members of both the sets A and B. In symbols,</p>

  <div><samp>A &cap; B = { x : x &isin; A and x &isin; B }</samp></div>

<p>That is, <strong>x</strong> is an element of the intersection A [sign] B if and only if <strong>x</strong> is both an element of <strong>A</strong> and an element of <strong>B</strong>.</p>
